```

## Testing Framework

This repository uses a custom testing framework based on pytest that extracts and tests code from specific cells in your notebooks. Make sure to:

- Write your solutions in cells tagged with `exercise1`, `exercise2`, etc.
- Don't modify the test files
- Run tests frequently to check your progress
